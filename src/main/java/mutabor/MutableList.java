	/**
	 * Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified
	 * <tt>fromIndex</tt>, inclusive, and <tt>toIndex</tt>, exclusive. (If
	 * <tt>fromIndex</tt> and <tt>toIndex</tt> are equal, the returned list is
	 * empty.) The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural
	 * changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
	 * The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported
	 * by this list.<p>
	 *
	 * This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
	 * the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
	 * a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view
	 * instead of a whole list. For example, the following idiom
	 * removes a range of elements from a list:
	 * <pre>
	 *     list.subList(from, to).clear();
	 * </pre>
	 * Similar idioms may be constructed for <tt>indexOf</tt> and
	 * <tt>lastIndexOf</tt>, and all of the algorithms in the
	 * <tt>Collections</tt> class can be applied to a subList.<p>
	 *
	 * The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if
	 * the backing list (i.e., this list) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
	 * any way other than via the returned list. (Structural modifications are
	 * those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such
	 * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)
	 *
	 * @param fromIndex low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
	 * @param toIndex high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList
	 * @return a view of the specified range within this list
	 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException for an illegal endpoint index value
	 * (<tt>fromIndex &lt; 0 || toIndex &gt; size ||
	 * fromIndex &gt; toIndex</tt>)
